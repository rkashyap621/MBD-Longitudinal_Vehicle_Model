# MBD Longitudinal Vehicle Model

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to model the longitudinal velocity of a vehicle using Newton's Second Law and implement the equation in Simulink. The model considers traction force and major opposing forces such as rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag, and road grade force.

## Basic Equation
A basic equation for modeling vehicle velocity comes from applying Newton's Second Law of Motion to the longitudinal motion of the vehicle.
The general longitudinal vehicle dynamics equation is:

$\large {m \frac{dv} {dt} = F_T - F_R}$

Where,
  * $\large m$ = vehicle mass ($\large {kg}$) 
  * $\large v$ = vehicle velocity ($\large {\frac{m} {s}}$) 
  * $\large \frac{dv} {dt}$ = acceleration ($\large {\frac{m} {s^2}}$) 
  * $\large F_T$ = traction (or driving) force from wheels/engine ($\large N$)  
  * $\large F_R$ = total opposing forces ($\large N$)

## Expanded Vehicle Velocity Model
The opposing (or resistive) forces are usually modeled as:

$\large {F_R = F_r + F_a + F_g}$

Thus: 

$\large {m \frac{dv} {dt} =  F_T - (F_r + F_a + F_g)}$

Or:

$\large {\frac{dv} {dt} = \frac{1} {m} [F_T - (F_r + F_a + F_g)]}$

Where,
  * $\large F_T$ = traction force ($\large N$)
  * $\large F_r$ = Rolling Resistance ($\large N$)
  * $\large F_a$ = aerodynamic drag ($\large N$)
  * $\large F_g$ = grade force ($\large N$)

For this model, rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag, and positive road grade are treated as opposing forces to the vehicle motion.

## Individual Force Equations
1. Rolling Resistance
2. Aerodynamic Drag
3. Road Grade Force (or Hill Force)

### 1. Rolling Resistance:
Rolling resistance is the force that opposes the motion of a wheel rolling on a surface.

It is mainly caused by:
 * Tire deformation 
 * Road deformation 
 * Internal friction inside the tire material 
 * Small slip losses at the contact patch

Even though the wheel rolls instead of sliding, energy is still lost.

For a vehicle on ground, the rolling resistance($\large F_r$) is defined as follows,

$\large {F_r = C_r m g}$

Where,
 * $\large F_r$ = rolling resistance force ($\large N$)
 * $\large C_r$ = rolling resistance coefficient ($\large {constant}$) 
 * $\large m$ = vehicle mass ($\large {kg}$) 
 * $\large g$ = gravitational acceleration ($\large {\frac{m} {s^2}}$)

Typical:
* $\large C_r \approx$ 0.01 to 0.02

### 2. Aerodynamic Drag
Aerodynamic drag is the force exerted by air that opposes the motion of a moving vehicle.

As a vehicle moves through air, it must push air molecules aside. This creates:
 * Pressure differences around the body 
 * Turbulence and wake formation 
 * Friction between air and vehicle surface

All of these contribute to drag.

The standard drag force equation is:

$\large {F_a = \frac{1} {2} \rho C_d A v^2}$

Where,
  * $\large F_a$ = aerodynamic drag force ($\large N$) 
  * $\large \rho$ = air density ($\large {\frac{kg} {m^3}}$) 
  * $\large C_d$ = drag coefficient ($\large {constant}$)  
  * $\large A$ = frontal area ($\large m^2$) 
  * $\large v$ = vehicle velocity relative to air ($\large {\frac{m} {s}}$)
 
**Why EVs Focus Heavily on Aerodynamics:**
 * High drag reduces driving range 
 * Highway efficiency is dominated by drag 
 * EVs therefore aim for:
   * Low drag coefficient
   * Smooth underbody
   * Active grille shutters
   * Aerodynamic wheel designs
 
### 3. Road Grade Force (or Hill Force)
Road grade force (or hill force) is the component of gravity acting along the slope of the road.

When a vehicle moves uphill, gravity pulls it backward.

When moving downhill, gravity assists the motion.

This force is an important part of longitudinal vehicle dynamics.

The standard road grade force equation is:

$\large {F_g = m g \sin(\theta)}$

Where,
  * $\large F_g$ = grade force ($\large N$) 
  * $\large m$ = vehicle mass ($\large {kg}$) 
  * $\large g$ = gravitational acceleration (9.81 $\large {\frac{m} {s^2}}$) 
  * $\large \theta$ = road slope angle ($\large radians$)
 
**Effect on Vehicle Performance:**
 * Acceleration capability 
 * Required engine torque 
 * Fuel consumption 
 * EV battery usage 
 * Regenerative braking 
 * Cruise control

## Final Differential Equation

$\large {m \frac {dv} {dt} = F_T - (C_rmg + \frac {1} {2} \rho C_d A v^2 + m g \sin(\theta))}$

Or:

$\large {\frac {dv} {dt} = \frac{1} {m} [F_T - C_rmg - \frac {1} {2} \rho C_d A v^2 - m g \sin(\theta)]}$

## Simulink Implementation
### MODEL-1: Longitudinal Vehicle Model (Baseline Model)
In this project, I began with the implementation of baseine model which represents longitudinal vehicle model. The baseline mode was implemented by computing each resisting force seperately, summing the opposing forces, subtracting them from the input traction force, dividing by vehicle mass to get the acceleration, integrating to obtain velocity, and convert the velocity result from m/s to km/h. The implemented Simulink model is shown below.

The implemented baseline model is available in the folder **'models/'** with the file name **'MDL1_Longitudinal_Vehicle_Model.slx'**.

## Model Parameters
The following are the model parameters that were used for simulationnn:
 * F_T = 3000 N (Input Traction Force)
 * m = 1200 kg (Vehicle Mass)
 * C_r = 0.015 (Rolling Coefficient)
 * g = 9.81 m/s² (Gravitational Acceleration)
 * rho = 1.225 kg/m³ (Air Density)
 * C_d = 0.32 (Drag Coefficient)
 * A = 2.2 m² (Vehicle Frontal Area)
 * theta = 0 rad (Road Slope Area)

## Simulation Result
After performing model simulation, I observed the final velocity to computed appoximately 159 km/h by the baseline model.
